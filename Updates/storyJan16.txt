- Bots are now off for ALL ZONES except the instanced GH you are ported to by Teleporter Zonfic in The Nexus. GET YOUR GEAR OFF OF BOTS IMMEDIATELY! This is NOT a permanent change and won't be around forever.<br><br>

- The main rules and information post has been expanded to encompass several other posts. This is an effort to pull all information into one post instead of 5 different ones.<br>
- As the first step in disabling bots, they no longer have any spell lists assigned to them. If you summon one and it doesn't heal you or anything, that's why. This is NOT a bug. :)<br>
- Bots will be disabled in all zones except for an instanced version of GH. You can reach this instance to remove bot equipment by buying a "Bot Equipment Management" port stone from Teleporter Zonfic in Nexus. Some notes about this zone:<br>
-- The timer on this instance is 1 hour. If it expires while you are inside, or if you camp out and don't come back before the timer expires, you will be ported to your bind point.<br>
-- The only working #bot commands will be to manage equipment. No ports, buffs or anything else will work now.<br><br>

- Teleporter Zonfic in The Nexus will now port you to various places around the world. He also sells Nexus gate potions so you can get back easily. Hopefully this will ease the pain of not having bots to port soon.<br><br>

- All GM NPCs are now able to be located with the find menu.<br><br>
