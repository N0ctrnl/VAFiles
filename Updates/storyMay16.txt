- Adjusted some named spawns and drop rates on random drops in Sebilis.<br>
- More AA cleanup in the general tab. Missed innate agility, but the rest should be capped at the proper number of ranks (up to PoP).<br>
- Updated server source. Part of this included some UCS (chat channel) changes. Please join a channel and see if it works any better than it historically has.<br><br>
