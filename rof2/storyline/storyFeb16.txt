- Website stuff!<br>
-- Character Browser - New Character Browser system! Check out the link at the top of the page. This will enable you to find characters just like on Magelo and see their gear and other things about them. In addition to that, it also has a list of what's currently for sale in the Bazaar. This is VERY cool and we're really glad to have it working!<br>
-- Clicking on a name on the in-game leaderboard will now launch their profile page on the Character Browser. Try it!<br>
-- The AllaClone has had unused zones removed. This should be helpful when trying to locate where items are found.<br><br>
